Does the interface compete with content?
Can content be bigger and more central?

Depth
Layering. orientation.
Do ppl get lost or disoriented in my app?
How do screens in my app spatially relate to each other?
How can animation provide a sense of continuity when users go from one screen to another?

## App Store Distribution and Marketing Tips
==========================================
App name matters. Be unique.

Icon should express your brand

Tell a story with your screenshots for App Store

App description is clean and concise. 2-3 sentences. Avoid accollades ("We've won 15 awards")

Keywords matter. Don't double up on keywords ("pictures, family pictures")

Universal app is better than separate iPhone/iPad apps. Single binary. Customers love convenience of one app.

Freemium isn't just IAP to remove ads.
Paid apps are not dead. They're a significant portion of the App Store.
Paymium is like paid upgrade. Using IAP, a paid upgrade is becoming more common.

Is Freemium right for you?
Freemium: A business model where a product or service is provided for free but money is charged for advanced features, functionality, or virtual goods.
1. What are your target market's expectations?
2. Can you segment the experience between free and paid?
3. Do you have a plan to create lasting value? They have long term plans to create value.

- Track your metrics (dls, retnetion, conversion)

Price throughtfully and competitively. Not all apps need to be $0.99. Consider your market.

Consider price promotions. Properly time them and don't do them often.

#### Communicate with Apple
- AppStorePromotion@apple.com: nominate your app for feature. Tell apple about your app.
- AppoftheWeek@apple.com: If you have a paid, universal, well localized app.

Plan for App Review to take time
- Plan for at least 2 weeks

Have a marketing plan
- Don't rely on being featured in App Store.

After Launch, monitor ratings and reviews.

Update your apps! Keep adding new features or optimize. Avoid releasing bug fixes every week. Every 6 weeks is the sweet spot.

Use Push Notifications and Sharing. Don't spam notifications.
